Hey!
If you aren't trying to update the OS, please close this.
If you are, continue.


Once you've checked for updates in the OS and downloaded the new update,
you should be able to close the OS, then delete all its files EXCEPT FOR
the automatically extracted update. Once you've done that, take the update
files and move them into the OS's main folder. Then you're done! If you've
done everything right, you should now be on the newest version of this OS!
